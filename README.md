# Regression-Analysis
In this repository, we have the report for all the code, and multivariate linear regression, polynomial regression and logistic regression implementations.

For Multivariate linear regression and polynomial regression:
1. A dataset that has results for concrete compressive strength [in MPa] based on 8 factors, namely amount of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate [all of these in the unit of kg, for every m^3 mixture] and age [in days] has be used.
2. This dataset has been taken from the University of California, Irvine [UCI] machine learning data repository.

For logistic regression:
1. A dataset that has results of students' admission based on two test scores.
2. This dataset has been taken from from ‘Machine learning by Stanford’ course on Coursera.
